This solved my problem when my new Stove didn't fit up against the back wall, it was a 3" gap. I knew that meant sooner or later something I kept on that top sill of the Stove (oven timer, salt & pepper shakers, etc.) would slip off & fall behind the Stove creating a nightmare trying to get it back out from behind there. I looked at several Stove shelves on & selected this one & am thrilled with it. My gap is now reduced drastically & the back lip of the new shelf will prevent items from slipping off & falling behind the Stove. 
My only regret is that I didn't buy this YEARS ago. I have a teeny tiny kitchen, so every space counts. This gave me a whole new shelf and opened up a ton of counter space that had been cluttered with overflow spices/oils. Shipped faster than expected, couldn't be easier to attach, and works perfectly. My stove sits far enough forward that the shelf doesn't reach to the wall behind it, but since it has a little lip along the back, it still looks and functions just fine. If your kitchen space is limited, this is a great help.
I have precious few counter spaces available to me! For years I asked my husband for a small shelf on my stove of which he said the ledge of the stove should suffice. It did not! Items ALWAYS fell off! Cruising the web I found this magnetic shelf and ordered it hoping it would be strong enough! OM GOODNESS is it strong! It securely fits on the top of the range and is thin enough to have a variety of items fit between the top of the stove and the microwave. BEST purchase to date!
Thank you, snapped on immediately, strong. Happy I did not use the magnet that came with it. Matched perfectly with my black whirlpool stove, no more clutter, now I can see what Iâ€™m out of and, just replace it with those in the cabinet.. No more buying the same seasoning over and, over. Came sooner than expected.
It makes the unusable space usable! It is great. My stove tilts down on the top. So, I did reverse it and have the back side thst is seen against the wall in the front. It provides a lip so things don't fall off. I only wish the distance between the stove and microwave was a little more so taller things could fit over the lip and onto the shelf, but that is the oddities of my kitchen and not the shelf!
 On to the product. Zero install is right. Pull the shelf out of the box, let the magnets take hold, and you're ready to go. You get a little lip in the front to stabilize it and a small rear guard. It's not extremely deep, so you can't store a ton of stuff on it. As you can see, it does hold a nice amount of cups. This brings me to the only issue. The shelf sits at a strong angle (see photo) so you want to choose carefully what you put on this thing. I figured that cups would be too big to fall behind the stove, and they'd certainly be okay near a heating source. I have a new stove on order, so if the shelf angles better I might try spice jars. But bottom line is that this is a pretty neat addition to the kitchen, offering some much-needed and convenient shelf space
 My stove top is slightly curved so I was not sure if this shelf would work. But it did beautifully! The magnets are in the center of the shelf and help adhere it strongly to the top of the stove. I love having extra storage space for spices I use often in cooking.
 I'm very happy that I found this handy little shelf. I had some frequently used spices out on the counter next to the stove, and I just didn't like the way it looked and used up prime space. This shelf is a great space-saver! The top of my stove isn't flat across and has a slight curvature, but the two bar magnets are strong enough to hold as long as the vertical lip in the back is flush against the wall and the spice bottles are touching it, it doesn't tip forward.
